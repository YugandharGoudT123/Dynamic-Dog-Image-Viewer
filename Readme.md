# Paws & Pixels: Dynamic Dog Image Viewer

Paws & Pixels is an interactive web app that loads dog breed information
and image galleries directly from the Dog API. Users can explore breeds
effortlessly while enjoying a sleek, auto-rotating slideshow experience.

This implementation follows and expands upon Brad Schiff’s educational
tutorial “Dogs, JavaScript & An API 🐶 Fetch, Promises & Async Await.”
All instructional credit belongs to him.
